ofxGCode Updates

[X] remove fbo
[] have everything represented by GLine
[] standardize the language around “clip inside”
[] size independent from window size

Stretch:
[] be able to tag lines so you can specify which ones to be removed in a culling
[] ofVe2f.isAligned could be helpful for recombining polylines


GLine Overhaul
[X] do things like last_x do anything? - No
[] remove GCodePoint class
[X] remove vector<GCodePoint> list
[X] remove pressure and speed
[X] make sure you can still draw dots
[X] make sure sorting works
	[X] sorting should consider clusters of lines that share the same start and end points as a group
[X] do you need to store vector<string> commands or just generate in the make gcode function?
[X] work on simplify() or remove it
	-I think you can just get rid of it TBH
[X] draw transit lines
[] clean up and remove commented out old code
[X] measureTransitDistance()
[X] variable for the M3 command (how far you drop the pen, currently 60)
[X] Can you use equals on the ofVec2fs or do you need a very small distance that you consider as the same?
	-this is for figuring out if pen goes up
	-drawing transit lines should use the same logic
	[X] get rid of are_points_the_same() and max_dist_to_consider_pnts_touching if not using
[X] make sure clipping plans still works and that you cannot go out of range
[X] make sure do not reverse works
	[X] and show_do_not_reverse
[X] do you need last_translate_id? (I don’t think so)
[X] test show_path_with_color
[X] static trim inside function that takes a vector of Glines and returns fixed vector
	[X] GLine trim function should take an optional vector pointer and put new liens there if it needs to split them up
[X] trim functions that take rect arguments


New features
[] rounded rect function
	[] option to export points
[] add hershey font
