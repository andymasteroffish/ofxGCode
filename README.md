# ofxGCode
GCode library for oF 0.11.0, mostly made with my axidraw in mind

This is based on my previous Eleksdraw library: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/ofxEleksDraw

The gcode is converted into something the axidraw can use via my python script: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/axidraw_gcode_reader
