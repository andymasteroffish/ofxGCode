# ofxGCode
GCode library for oF 0.11.0, mostly made with my axidraw in mind

The gcode is converted into something the axidraw can use via my python script: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/axidraw_gcode_reader

I did some pretty major updates after Inktober 2020. The new version is not completely backwards compatible, but you can find it in the "classic" branch of this repo.

This is a work in progress. Some parts are a bit buggy. I'll add features as I need 'em.

If you like my plotter work, you can buy some of it here: https://andymakes.bigcartel.com/

This library incorporates some features from these repos:
